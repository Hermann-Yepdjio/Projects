/*Good, you’re here. For most assignments we will provide you with a solution skeleton that you have to modify as part of the assignment. To the right of this text you can see a text box containing such a solution skeleton. This text box is actually an editor. When you answer questions you will have to place your solution in the editors.

At the top left of the page there is a button labelled [Submission]. If that is not already highlighted, you should click it now and it will take you to your submission page for the current assignment.

Good. To the right of this text you have an editor with two tabs:

Solution
Test

object Speak { 

  def greet() = {
    "Hello world"
  }

}
