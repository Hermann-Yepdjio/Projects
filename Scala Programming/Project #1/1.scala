/*
Welcome to the editor where you will provide your solution 
code to assignments. You can create objects and classes with 
methods in this editor. We will normally give you a solution 
skeleton such as the one below. You can modify the skeleton
by typing anywhere.  Make a trivial modification somewhere,
e.g. by adding a space to this comment. Notice that there is
now an orange button [Save*].  Go ahead and press that button 
to save your trivial change.  Observe that the button now turns 
green and its label changes to [Saved].

Now lets see if the code compiles.  To do that, press the
the blue button labelled [Your test]. This will make
the system attempt to compile your solution and then 
compile and run your tests (more on that in a minute).

Hmm. It looks like there is a compilation error in the solution: 
we've forgotten to close the string. Go ahead and correct the error 
then press [Save] and [Your Test] again. 

Oops. Seems like there is still an error.  Switch to the "Test" tab to
try and fix it...
