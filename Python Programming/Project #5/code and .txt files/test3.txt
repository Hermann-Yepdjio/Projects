CHAPTER X

Eccentricity of the English--Castelbajac Count Schwerin--Sophie at
School--My Reception at the Betting Club--The Charpillon


I passed a night which seemed like a never-ending nightmare, and I
got up sad and savage, feeling as if I could kill a man on the
smallest provocation. It seemed as if the house, which I had
hitherto thought so beautiful, was like a millstone about my neck.
I went out in my travelling clothes, and walked into a coffee-house,
where I saw a score of people reading the papers.

I sat down, and, not understanding English, passed my time in gazing
at the goers and comers. I had been there some time when my
attention was attracted by the voice of a man speaking as follows in
French:

"Tommy has committed suicide, and he was wise, for he was in such a
state that he could only expect unhappiness for the rest of his
life."

"You are quite mistaken," said the other, with the greatest
composure. "I was one of his creditors myself, and on making an
inventory of his effects I feel satisfied that he has done a very
foolish and a very childish thing; he might have lived on
comfortably, and not killed himself for fully six months."

At any other time this calculation would have made me laugh, and, as
it was, I felt as if the incident had done me good.

I left the coffee-house without having said a word or spent a penny,
and I went towards the Exchange to get some money. Bosanquet gave me
what I wanted directly, and as I walked out with him I noticed a
curious-looking individual, whose name I asked.

"He's worth a hundred thousand," said the banker.

"And who is that other man over there?"

"He's not worth a ten-pound note."

"But I don't want to hear what they are worth; it's their names I
want."

"I really don't know."

"How can you tell how much they are worth, not knowing their names?"

"Names don't go for anything here. What we want to know about a man
is how much he has got? Besides; what's in a name? Ask me for a
thousand pounds and give me a proper receipt, and you can do it under
the name of Socrates or Attila, for all I care. You will pay me back
my money as Socrates or Attila, and not as Seingalt; that is all."

"But how about signing bills of exchange?"

"That's another thing; I must use the name which the drawer gives
me."

"I don't understand that."

"Well, you see, you are not English, nor are you a business man."

On leaving him I walked towards the park, but wishing to change a
twenty-pound note before going in I went to a fat merchant, an
epicure whose acquaintance I had made at the tavern, and put down the
note on his counter, begging him to cash it for me.

"Come again in an hour," said he, "I have no money by me just now."

"Very good; I will call again when I come from the park."

"Take back your note; you shall give it to me when I hand you the
money."

"Never mind; keep it. I don't doubt your honesty."

"Don't be so foolish. If you left me the note I should certainly
decline to hand over the money, if only for the sake of giving you a
lesson."

"I don't believe you are capable of such dishonesty."

"Nor am I, but when it comes to such a simple thing as putting a bank
note in your pocket, the most honest man in the world would never
dream of having such a thing in his possession without having paid
the money for it, and the least slip of memory might lead to a
dispute in which you would infallibly come off second best."

"I feel the force of your arguments, especially in a town where so
much business is carried on."

When I got into the park I met Martinelli and thanked him for sending
me a copy of the Decameron, while he congratulated me on my re-
appearance in society, and on the young lady of whom I had been the
happy possessor and no doubt the slave.

"My Lord Pembroke has seen her," said he, "and thought her charming."

"What? Where could he have seen her?"

"In a carriage with you driving fast along the Rochester road. It is
three or four days ago."

"Then I may tell you that I was taking her to Calais; I shall never
see her face again."

"Will you let the room again in the same way?"

"No, never again, though the god of love has been propitious to me.
I shall be glad to see you at my house whenever you like to come."

"Shall I send you a note to warn you?"

"Not at all."

We walked on talking about literature, manners, and so forth, in an
aimless way. All at once, as we approached Buckingham House, I saw
five or six persons, relieving nature amidst the bushes, with their
hinder parts facing the passers-by. I thought this a disgusting
piece of indecency, and said as much to Martinelli, adding that the
impudent rascals might at least turn their faces towards the path.

"Not at all," he exclaimed, "for then they might be recognized;
whereas in exposing their posteriors they run no such risk; besides
the sight makes squeamish persons turn away."

"You are right, but you will confess that the whole thing strikes a
stranger as very revolting."

"Yes, there is nothing so ineradicable as national prejudice. You
may have noticed that when an Englishman wants to ease his sluices in
the street, he doesn't run up an alley or turn to the wall like we
do."

"Yes, I have noticed them turning towards the middle of the street,
but if they thus escape the notice of the people in the shops and on
the pavement they are seen by everybody who is driving in a carriage,
and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

We walked on to the Green Park, and met Lord Pembroke on horseback.
He stopped and burst into exclamations on seeing me. As I guessed
the cause of his surprise, I hastened to tell him that I was a free
man once more, to my sorrow, and felt lonely amidst my splendour.

"I feel rather curious about it, and perhaps I may come and keep you
company to-day."

We parted, and reckoning on seeing him at dinner I, went back to tell
my cook that dinner was to be served in the large room. Martinelli
had an engagement and could not come to dinner, but he led me out of
the park by a door with which I was not acquainted, and sent me on my
way.

As we were going along we saw a crowd of people who seemed to be
staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

"That's a curious sight for you; you can enter it amidst your remarks
on English manners."

"What is it?"

"A man at the point of death from a blow he has received in boxing
with another sturdy fellow."

"Cannot anything be done?"

"There is a surgeon there who would bleed him, if he were allowed."

"Who could prevent him?"

"That's the curious part of it. Two men have betted on his death or
recovery. One says, 'I'll bet twenty guineas he dies,' and the other
says, 'Done.' Number one will not allow the surgeon to bleed him,
for if the man recovered his twenty guineas would be gone."

"Poor man! what pitiless betters!"

"The English are very strange in their betting proclivities; they bet
about everything. There is a Betting Club to which I will introduce
you, if you like."

"Do they speak French there?"

"Most certainly, for it is composed of men of wit and mark."

"What do they do?"

"They talk and argue, and if one man brings forward a proposition
which another denies, and one backs his opinion, the other has to bet
too, on pain of a fine which goes to the common fund."

"Introduce me to this delightful club, by all means; it will make my
fortune, for I shall always take care to be on the right side."

"You had better be careful; they are wary birds."

"But to return to the dying man; what will be done to his
antagonist?"

"His hand will be examined, and if it is found to be just the same as
yours or mine it will be marked, and he will be let go."

Eccentricity of the English--Castelbajac Count Schwerin--Sophie at
School--My Reception at the Betting Club--The Charpillon


I passed a night which seemed like a never-ending nightmare, and I
got up sad and savage, feeling as if I could kill a man on the
smallest provocation. It seemed as if the house, which I had
hitherto thought so beautiful, was like a millstone about my neck.
I went out in my travelling clothes, and walked into a coffee-house,
where I saw a score of people reading the papers.

I sat down, and, not understanding English, passed my time in gazing
at the goers and comers. I had been there some time when my
attention was attracted by the voice of a man speaking as follows in
French:

"Tommy has committed suicide, and he was wise, for he was in such a
state that he could only expect unhappiness for the rest of his
life."

"You are quite mistaken," said the other, with the greatest
composure. "I was one of his creditors myself, and on making an
inventory of his effects I feel satisfied that he has done a very
foolish and a very childish thing; he might have lived on
comfortably, and not killed himself for fully six months."

At any other time this calculation would have made me laugh, and, as
it was, I felt as if the incident had done me good.

I left the coffee-house without having said a word or spent a penny,
and I went towards the Exchange to get some money. Bosanquet gave me
what I wanted directly, and as I walked out with him I noticed a
curious-looking individual, whose name I asked.

"He's worth a hundred thousand," said the banker.

"And who is that other man over there?"

"He's not worth a ten-pound note."

"But I don't want to hear what they are worth; it's their names I
want."

"I really don't know."

"How can you tell how much they are worth, not knowing their names?"

"Names don't go for anything here. What we want to know about a man
is how much he has got? Besides; what's in a name? Ask me for a
thousand pounds and give me a proper receipt, and you can do it under
the name of Socrates or Attila, for all I care. You will pay me back
my money as Socrates or Attila, and not as Seingalt; that is all."

"But how about signing bills of exchange?"

"That's another thing; I must use the name which the drawer gives
me."

"I don't understand that."

"Well, you see, you are not English, nor are you a business man."

On leaving him I walked towards the park, but wishing to change a
twenty-pound note before going in I went to a fat merchant, an
epicure whose acquaintance I had made at the tavern, and put down the
note on his counter, begging him to cash it for me.

"Come again in an hour," said he, "I have no money by me just now."

"Very good; I will call again when I come from the park."

"Take back your note; you shall give it to me when I hand you the
money."

"Never mind; keep it. I don't doubt your honesty."

"Don't be so foolish. If you left me the note I should certainly
decline to hand over the money, if only for the sake of giving you a
lesson."

"I don't believe you are capable of such dishonesty."

"Nor am I, but when it comes to such a simple thing as putting a bank
note in your pocket, the most honest man in the world would never
dream of having such a thing in his possession without having paid
the money for it, and the least slip of memory might lead to a
dispute in which you would infallibly come off second best."

"I feel the force of your arguments, especially in a town where so
much business is carried on."

When I got into the park I met Martinelli and thanked him for sending
me a copy of the Decameron, while he congratulated me on my re-
appearance in society, and on the young lady of whom I had been the
happy possessor and no doubt the slave.

"My Lord Pembroke has seen her," said he, "and thought her charming."

"What? Where could he have seen her?"

"In a carriage with you driving fast along the Rochester road. It is
three or four days ago."

"Then I may tell you that I was taking her to Calais; I shall never
see her face again."

"Will you let the room again in the same way?"

"No, never again, though the god of love has been propitious to me.
I shall be glad to see you at my house whenever you like to come."

"Shall I send you a note to warn you?"

"Not at all."

We walked on talking about literature, manners, and so forth, in an
aimless way. All at once, as we approached Buckingham House, I saw
five or six persons, relieving nature amidst the bushes, with their
hinder parts facing the passers-by. I thought this a disgusting
piece of indecency, and said as much to Martinelli, adding that the
impudent rascals might at least turn their faces towards the path.

"Not at all," he exclaimed, "for then they might be recognized;
whereas in exposing their posteriors they run no such risk; besides
the sight makes squeamish persons turn away."

"You are right, but you will confess that the whole thing strikes a
stranger as very revolting."

"Yes, there is nothing so ineradicable as national prejudice. You
may have noticed that when an Englishman wants to ease his sluices in
the street, he doesn't run up an alley or turn to the wall like we
do."

"Yes, I have noticed them turning towards the middle of the street,
but if they thus escape the notice of the people in the shops and on
the pavement they are seen by everybody who is driving in a carriage,
and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

We walked on to the Green Park, and met Lord Pembroke on horseback.
He stopped and burst into exclamations on seeing me. As I guessed
the cause of his surprise, I hastened to tell him that I was a free
man once more, to my sorrow, and felt lonely amidst my splendour.

"I feel rather curious about it, and perhaps I may come and keep you
company to-day."

We parted, and reckoning on seeing him at dinner I, went back to tell
my cook that dinner was to be served in the large room. Martinelli
had an engagement and could not come to dinner, but he led me out of
the park by a door with which I was not acquainted, and sent me on my
way.

As we were going along we saw a crowd of people who seemed to be
staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

"That's a curious sight for you; you can enter it amidst your remarks
on English manners."

"What is it?"

"A man at the point of death from a blow he has received in boxing
with another sturdy fellow."

"Cannot anything be done?"

"There is a surgeon there who would bleed him, if he were allowed."

"Who could prevent him?"

"That's the curious part of it. Two men have betted on his death or
recovery. One says, 'I'll bet twenty guineas he dies,' and the other
says, 'Done.' Number one will not allow the surgeon to bleed him,
for if the man recovered his twenty guineas would be gone."

"Poor man! what pitiless betters!"

"The English are very strange in their betting proclivities; they bet
about everything. There is a Betting Club to which I will introduce
you, if you like."

"Do they speak French there?"

"Most certainly, for it is composed of men of wit and mark."

staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

"That's a curious sight for you; you can enter it amidst your remarks
on English manners."

"What is it?"

"A man at the point of death from a blow he has received in boxing
with another sturdy fellow."

"Cannot anything be done?"

"There is a surgeon there who would bleed him, if he were allowed."

"Who could prevent him?"

"That's the curious part of it. Two men have betted on his death or
recovery. One says, 'I'll bet twenty guineas he dies,' and the other
says, 'Done.' Number one will not allow the surgeon to bleed him,
for if the man recovered his twenty guineas would be gone."

"Poor man! what pitiless betters!"

"The English are very strange in their betting proclivities; they bet
about everything. There is a Betting Club to which I will introduce
you, if you like."

"Do they speak French there?"

"Most certainly, for it is composed of men of wit and mark."

"What do they do?"

"They talk and argue, and if one man brings forward a proposition
which another denies, and one backs his opinion, the other has to bet
too, on pain of a fine which goes to the common fund."

"Introduce me to this delightful club, by all means; it will make my
fortune, for I shall always take care to be on the right side."

"You had better be careful; they are wary birds."

"But to return to the dying man; what will be done to his
antagonist?"

"His hand will be examined, and if it is found to be just the same as
yours or mine it will be marked, and he will be let go."CHAPTER X

Eccentricity of the English--Castelbajac Count Schwerin--Sophie at
School--My Reception at the Betting Club--The Charpillon


I passed a night which seemed like a never-ending nightmare, and I
got up sad and savage, feeling as if I could kill a man on the
smallest provocation. It seemed as if the house, which I had
hitherto thought so beautiful, was like a millstone about my neck.
I went out in my travelling clothes, and walked into a coffee-house,
where I saw a score of people reading the papers.

I sat down, and, not understanding English, passed my time in gazing
at the goers and comers. I had been there some time when my
attention was attracted by the voice of a man speaking as follows in
French:

"Tommy has committed suicide, and he was wise, for he was in such a
state that he could only expect unhappiness for the rest of his
life."

"You are quite mistaken," said the other, with the greatest
composure. "I was one of his creditors myself, and on making an
inventory of his effects I feel satisfied that he has done a very
foolish and a very childish thing; he might have lived on
comfortably, and not killed himself for fully six months."

At any other time this calculation would have made me laugh, and, as
it was, I felt as if the incident had done me good.

I left the coffee-house without having said a word or spent a penny,
and I went towards the Exchange to get some money. Bosanquet gave me
what I wanted directly, and as I walked out with him I noticed a
curious-looking individual, whose name I asked.

"He's worth a hundred thousand," said the banker.

"And who is that other man over there?"

"He's not worth a ten-pound note."

"But I don't want to hear what they are worth; it's their names I
want."

"I really don't know."

"How can you tell how much they are worth, not knowing their names?"

"Names don't go for anything here. What we want to know about a man
is how much he has got? Besides; what's in a name? Ask me for a
thousand pounds and give me a proper receipt, and you can do it under
the name of Socrates or Attila, for all I care. You will pay me back
my money as Socrates or Attila, and not as Seingalt; that is all."

"But how about signing bills of exchange?"

"That's another thing; I must use the name which the drawer gives
me."

"I don't understand that."

"Well, you see, you are not English, nor are you a business man."

On leaving him I walked towards the park, but wishing to change a
twenty-pound note before going in I went to a fat merchant, an
epicure whose acquaintance I had made at the tavern, and put down the
note on his counter, begging him to cash it for me.

"Come again in an hour," said he, "I have no money by me just now."

"Very good; I will call again when I come from the park."

"Take back your note; you shall give it to me when I hand you the
money."

"Never mind; keep it. I don't doubt your honesty."

"Don't be so foolish. If you left me the note I should certainly
decline to hand over the money, if only for the sake of giving you a
lesson."

"I don't believe you are capable of such dishonesty."

"Nor am I, but when it comes to such a simple thing as putting a bank
note in your pocket, the most honest man in the world would never
dream of having such a thing in his possession without having paid
the money for it, and the least slip of memory might lead to a
dispute in which you would infallibly come off second best."

"I feel the force of your arguments, especially in a town where so
much business is carried on."

When I got into the park I met Martinelli and thanked him for sending
me a copy of the Decameron, while he congratulated me on my re-
appearance in society, and on the young lady of whom I had been the
happy possessor and no doubt the slave.

"My Lord Pembroke has seen her," said he, "and thought her charming."

"What? Where could he have seen her?"

"In a carriage with you driving fast along the Rochester road. It is
three or four days ago."

"Then I may tell you that I was taking her to Calais; I shall never
see her face again."

"Will you let the room again in the same way?"

"No, never again, though the god of love has been propitious to me.
I shall be glad to see you at my house whenever you like to come."

"Shall I send you a note to warn you?"

"Not at all."

We walked on talking about literature, manners, and so forth, in an
aimless way. All at once, as we approached Buckingham House, I saw
five or six persons, relieving nature amidst the bushes, with their
hinder parts facing the passers-by. I thought this a disgusting
piece of indecency, and said as much to Martinelli, adding that the
impudent rascals might at least turn their faces towards the path.

"Not at all," he exclaimed, "for then they might be recognized;
whereas in exposing their posteriors they run no such risk; besides
the sight makes squeamish persons turn away."

"You are right, but you will confess that the whole thing strikes a
stranger as very revolting."

"Yes, there is nothing so ineradicable as national prejudice. You
may have noticed that when an Englishman wants to ease his sluices in
the street, he doesn't run up an alley or turn to the wall like we
do."

"Yes, I have noticed them turning towards the middle of the street,
but if they thus escape the notice of the people in the shops and on
the pavement they are seen by everybody who is driving in a carriage,
and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

We walked on to the Green Park, and met Lord Pembroke on horseback.
He stopped and burst into exclamations on seeing me. As I guessed
the cause of his surprise, I hastened to tell him that I was a free
man once more, to my sorrow, and felt lonely amidst my splendour.

"I feel rather curious about it, and perhaps I may come and keep you
company to-day."

We parted, and reckoning on seeing him at dinner I, went back to tell
my cook that dinner was to be served in the large room. Martinelli
had an engagement and could not come to dinner, but he led me out of
the park by a door with which I was not acquainted, and sent me on my
way.

As we were going along we saw a crowd of people who seemed to be
staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

We walked on to the Green Park, and met Lord Pembroke on horseback.
He stopped and burst into exclamations on seeing me. As I guessed
the cause of his surprise, I hastened to tell him that I was a free
man once more, to my sorrow, and felt lonely amidst my splendour.

"I feel rather curious about it, and perhaps I may come and keep you
company to-day."

We parted, and reckoning on seeing him at dinner I, went back to tell
my cook that dinner was to be served in the large room. Martinelli
had an engagement and could not come to dinner, but he led me out of
the park by a door with which I was not acquainted, and sent me on my
way.

As we were going along we saw a crowd of people who seemed to be
staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

"That's a curious sight for you; you can enter it amidst your remarks
on English manners."

"What is it?"

"A man at the point of death from a blow he has received in boxing
with another sturdy fellow."

"Cannot anything be done?"

"There is a surgeon there who would bleed him, if he were allowed."

"Who could prevent him?"

"That's the curious part of it. Two men have betted on his death or
recovery. One says, 'I'll bet twenty guineas he dies,' and the other
says, 'Done.' Number one will not allow the surgeon to bleed him,
for if the man recovered his twenty guineas would be gone."

"Poor man! what pitiless betters!"

"The English are very strange in their betting proclivities; they bet
about everything. There is a Betting Club to which I will introduce
you, if you like."

"Do they speak French there?"

"Most certainly, for it is composed of men of wit and mark."

"What do they do?"

"They talk and argue, and if one man brings forward a proposition
which another denies, and one backs his opinion, the other has to bet
too, on pain of a fine which goes to the common fund."

"Introduce me to this delightful club, by all means; it will make my
fortune, for I shall always take care to be on the right side."

"You had better be careful; they are wary birds."

"But to return to the dying man; what will be done to his
antagonist?"

"His hand will be examined, and if it is found to be just the same as
yours or mine it will be marked, and he will be let go."CHAPTER X

Eccentricity of the English--Castelbajac Count Schwerin--Sophie at
School--My Reception at the Betting Club--The Charpillon


I passed a night which seemed like a never-ending nightmare, and I
got up sad and savage, feeling as if I could kill a man on the
smallest provocation. It seemed as if the house, which I had
hitherto thought so beautiful, was like a millstone about my neck.
I went out in my travelling clothes, and walked into a coffee-house,
where I saw a score of people reading the papers.

I sat down, and, not understanding English, passed my time in gazing
at the goers and comers. I had been there some time when my
attention was attracted by the voice of a man speaking as follows in
French:

"Tommy has committed suicide, and he was wise, for he was in such a
state that he could only expect unhappiness for the rest of his
life."

"You are quite mistaken," said the other, with the greatest
composure. "I was one of his creditors myself, and on making an
inventory of his effects I feel satisfied that he has done a very
foolish and a very childish thing; he might have lived on
comfortably, and not killed himself for fully six months."

At any other time this calculation would have made me laugh, and, as
it was, I felt as if the incident had done me good.

I left the coffee-house without having said a word or spent a penny,
and I went towards the Exchange to get some money. Bosanquet gave me
what I wanted directly, and as I walked out with him I noticed a
curious-looking individual, whose name I asked.

"He's worth a hundred thousand," said the banker.

"And who is that other man over there?"

"He's not worth a ten-pound note."

"But I don't want to hear what they are worth; it's their names I
want."

"I really don't know."

"How can you tell how much they are worth, not knowing their names?"

"Names don't go for anything here. What we want to know about a man
is how much he has got? Besides; what's in a name? Ask me for a
thousand pounds and give me a proper receipt, and you can do it under
the name of Socrates or Attila, for all I care. You will pay me back
my money as Socrates or Attila, and not as Seingalt; that is all."

"But how about signing bills of exchange?"

"That's another thing; I must use the name which the drawer gives
me."

"I don't understand that."

"Well, you see, you are not English, nor are you a business man."

On leaving him I walked towards the park, but wishing to change a
twenty-pound note before going in I went to a fat merchant, an
epicure whose acquaintance I had made at the tavern, and put down the
note on his counter, begging him to cash it for me.

"Come again in an hour," said he, "I have no money by me just now."

"Very good; I will call again when I come from the park."

"Take back your note; you shall give it to me when I hand you the
money."

"Never mind; keep it. I don't doubt your honesty."

"Don't be so foolish. If you left me the note I should certainly
decline to hand over the money, if only for the sake of giving you a
lesson."

"I don't believe you are capable of such dishonesty."

"Nor am I, but when it comes to such a simple thing as putting a bank
note in your pocket, the most honest man in the world would never
dream of having such a thing in his possession without having paid
the money for it, and the least slip of memory might lead to a
dispute in which you would infallibly come off second best."

"I feel the force of your arguments, especially in a town where so
much business is carried on."

When I got into the park I met Martinelli and thanked him for sending
me a copy of the Decameron, while he congratulated me on my re-
appearance in society, and on the young lady of whom I had been the
happy possessor and no doubt the slave.

"My Lord Pembroke has seen her," said he, "and thought her charming."

"What? Where could he have seen her?"

"In a carriage with you driving fast along the Rochester road. It is
three or four days ago."

"Then I may tell you that I was taking her to Calais; I shall never
see her face again."

"Will you let the room again in the same way?"

"No, never again, though the god of love has been propitious to me.
I shall be glad to see you at my house whenever you like to come."

"Shall I send you a note to warn you?"

"Not at all."

We walked on talking about literature, manners, and so forth, in an
aimless way. All at once, as we approached Buckingham House, I saw
five or six persons, relieving nature amidst the bushes, with their
hinder parts facing the passers-by. I thought this a disgusting
piece of indecency, and said as much to Martinelli, adding that the
impudent rascals might at least turn their faces towards the path.

"Not at all," he exclaimed, "for then they might be recognized;
whereas in exposing their posteriors they run no such risk; besides
the sight makes squeamish persons turn away."

"You are right, but you will confess that the whole thing strikes a
stranger as very revolting."

"Yes, there is nothing so ineradicable as national prejudice. You
may have noticed that when an Englishman wants to ease his sluices in
the street, he doesn't run up an alley or turn to the wall like we
do."

"Yes, I have noticed them turning towards the middle of the street,
but if they thus escape the notice of the people in the shops and on
the pavement they are seen by everybody who is driving in a carriage,
and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

hinder parts facing the passers-by. I thought this a disgusting
piece of indecency, and said as much to Martinelli, adding that the
impudent rascals might at least turn their faces towards the path.

"Not at all," he exclaimed, "for then they might be recognized;
whereas in exposing their posteriors they run no such risk; besides
the sight makes squeamish persons turn away."

"You are right, but you will confess that the whole thing strikes a
stranger as very revolting."

"Yes, there is nothing so ineradicable as national prejudice. You
may have noticed that when an Englishman wants to ease his sluices in
the street, he doesn't run up an alley or turn to the wall like we
do."

"Yes, I have noticed them turning towards the middle of the street,
but if they thus escape the notice of the people in the shops and on
the pavement they are seen by everybody who is driving in a carriage,
and that is as bad."

"The people in the carriages need not look."

"That is true"

We walked on to the Green Park, and met Lord Pembroke on horseback.
He stopped and burst into exclamations on seeing me. As I guessed
the cause of his surprise, I hastened to tell him that I was a free
man once more, to my sorrow, and felt lonely amidst my splendour.

"I feel rather curious about it, and perhaps I may come and keep you
company to-day."

We parted, and reckoning on seeing him at dinner I, went back to tell
my cook that dinner was to be served in the large room. Martinelli
had an engagement and could not come to dinner, but he led me out of
the park by a door with which I was not acquainted, and sent me on my
way.

As we were going along we saw a crowd of people who seemed to be
staring at something. Martinelli went up to the crowd, and then
returned to me, saying,--

"That's a curious sight for you; you can enter it amidst your remarks
on English manners."

"What is it?"

"A man at the point of death from a blow he has received in boxing
with another sturdy fellow."

"Cannot anything be done?"

"There is a surgeon there who would bleed him, if he were allowed."

"Who could prevent him?"

"That's the curious part of it. Two men have betted on his death or
recovery. One says, 'I'll bet twenty guineas he dies,' and the other
says, 'Done.' Number one will not allow the surgeon to bleed him,
for if the man recovered his twenty guineas would be gone."

"Poor man! what pitiless betters!"

"The English are very strange in their betting proclivities; they bet
about everything. There is a Betting Club to which I will introduce
you, if you like."

"Do they speak French there?"

"Most certainly, for it is composed of men of wit and mark."

"What do they do?"

"They talk and argue, and if one man brings forward a proposition
which another denies, and one backs his opinion, the other has to bet
too, on pain of a fine which goes to the common fund."

"Introduce me to this delightful club, by all means; it will make my
fortune, for I shall always take care to be on the right side."

"You had better be careful; they are wary birds."

"But to return to the dying man; what will be done to his
antagonist?"

"His hand will be examined, and if it is found to be just the same as
yours or mine it will be marked, and he will be let go."
